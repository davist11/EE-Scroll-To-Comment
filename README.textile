An ExpressionEngine 2.x compatible extension to scroll to the newly submitted comment. This is ported over from "Matthew Pennell's 1.x version":http://www.thewatchmakerproject.com/blog/new-expressionengine-extension-scroll-to-new-comment.

# Drop the scroll_to_comment folder into the third_party folder
# Activate the extension
# Edit the settings to adjust the comment prefix (defaults to comment)
# Update the comments output to include a unique ID for each comment: id="comment_{comment_id}"
